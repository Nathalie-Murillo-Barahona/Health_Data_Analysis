## Introduction

This project will analyze obesity rates in counties and compare to the
number of farmers markets in the same counties. I hope to analyze the
relationship between obesity and access to fresh produce.

## Data

I got this data from the CDC’s Nutrition, Physical Activity, and
Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the Department
of Agriculture Farmers Markets Directory and Geographic Data. The
dimensions of the CDC’s data is 88,600 rows and 33 columns. The DOA data
set has 1,682 rows and 59 rows.
